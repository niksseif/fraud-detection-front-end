# fraud-detection-front-end
Description
Front-end dashboard built with React for (hypothetical) employees at an event company to review and flag potentially fraudulent events (in real time) based on a data model that surfaces the likelihood of an event being fraudulent.

This was built by Nsseif in less than 2 days as part of a collaborative case study in partnership with 4 members from Galvanize's Data Science Immersive. 
The Data Science team analyzed training data to build the model as well as the API and the front-end pulls in the latest events in real-time.

NOTE: The data is too sensitive to share publicly, so this uses made-up events from a simple API.
